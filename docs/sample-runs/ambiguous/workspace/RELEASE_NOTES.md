## Changes

- Q-PERF: bounded TTL read-through cache on the redirect path (p95 < 50 ms)
- Q-SAFETY: configurable domain denylist (incl. subdomains)

## Known risks / follow-ups

- assumption: Q-PERF: assumed 'p95 < 50 ms in-process (read-through cache, no new infrastructure)' (non-blocking; confirm or override)
- assumption: Q-SAFETY: assumed 'Add a configurable domain denylist for known-bad domains' (non-blocking; confirm or override)
