# Design record

Architecture: layered Spring Boot service: web -> service -> repository (JDBC) -> Flyway-managed schema

## Capabilities

- **analytics**: Per-link total clicks, daily breakdown and top referrer hosts; Click recording never delays the redirect response
- **custom_alias**: Aliases are 3-32 chars [A-Za-z0-9_-] and cannot shadow service routes; A taken alias returns 409
- **expiry**: Links may carry an optional expiry in the future; Expired links return 410 Gone
- **link_creation**: POST /api/v1/links returns 201 with code and short_url; Generated codes are random base62, not sequential or enumerable; Code collisions are retried transparently
- **rate_limiting**: Link creation is limited per API key; excess returns 429 + Retry-After
- **redirect**: GET /{code} returns 302 to the target; Unknown codes return 404; deleted or expired codes return 410
- **reliability**: Create is safe to retry with Idempotency-Key; /healthz (liveness) and /readyz (database check); Every response carries X-Request-ID
- **url_safety**: Only http(s) targets are accepted; script/data/file schemes are rejected with 400; URLs with embedded credentials are rejected

## Decisions (ADRs)

### ADR-01: Record clicks off the request thread; store referrer host + user-agent family only

Keeps redirect latency independent of analytics writes and minimises personal data.

Alternatives considered: Synchronous write (simpler, slower); Event queue such as Kafka (scales, more infrastructure)

### ADR-02: Expiry evaluated at read time; 410 Gone

No background job required; expired rows remain for audit and analytics.

Alternatives considered: Background purge job

### ADR-03: Random base62 codes (7 chars, SecureRandom) with collision retry

62^7 ≈ 3.5e12 codes; random codes cannot be enumerated, unlike sequential ids.

Alternatives considered: Sequential id + base62 (enumerable); Hash of the URL (dedups, but leaks equality)

### ADR-04: In-process token bucket keyed by API-key owner

Zero infrastructure for a single instance; swap for Redis or the API gateway when scaled out.

Alternatives considered: Redis sliding window (multi-instance); API gateway limits

### ADR-05: 302 + Cache-Control: no-store for redirects

Every click must reach the service for analytics; 301 is cached by browsers.

Alternatives considered: 301 Moved Permanently (cheaper, but under-counts)

### ADR-06: Spring JDBC + Flyway on H2 for the prototype, behind a repository class

Zero-ops, transactional and migration-managed; the JDBC URL switches it to PostgreSQL.

Alternatives considered: PostgreSQL now (more ops for a prototype); JPA/Hibernate (more abstraction than needed)

### ADR-07: Validate targets at the boundary; never fetch them

Blocks script schemes, credential spoofing and internal hosts without network I/O.

Alternatives considered: Fetch-and-inspect targets (SSRF risk, latency)
